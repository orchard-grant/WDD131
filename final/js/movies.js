    "description": "I love this movie because it pushes what you would think a music and a romance movie would do. I apologize for the spoilers, but the lead two characters don't end up together, but still end up with what they wanted, their dreams fulfilled. I think this is a good representation of how that one person can push us to accomplish our dreams, without ending up with that person.",

    "poster": "images/django.jpg",
    "description": "I normally don't like western styled movies, but this is one of my favorites. I think that Jamie Foxx does an incredible job, and the entire supporting cast does amazing too. I've seen this movie so many times, and it never gets old.",

    "year": 2019,
    "rating": 9.4,
    "director": "Rian Johnson",
    "poster": "images/knives.jpg",
    "description": "This is my favorite mystery movie, and a great 'who done it', with the reveal being legendary. It reminds me of the board game Clue. Despite the reveal, I find myself rewatching this movie frequently. I feel like each sequel is trying to capture the magic of this first movie.",

    "year": 2014,
    "rating": 9.9,
    "director": "Damien Chazelle",
    "poster": "images/whiplash.jpg",
    "description": "This is easily my favorite movie of all time. I love music, and I love tension, and this movie pushes both to 100%. The two leads, Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons do an incredible job. This movie pushes the message that we need to push ourselves to become great, and I think that's beautiful.",
