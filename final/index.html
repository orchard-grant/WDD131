      <h2>Welcome to GrantBoxd</h2>
      <p>My personal top movie picks, and movie searching database. This first page is a collection of my top movies, as well as why I love
        these movies. I have seen so many movies, with over 600 movies logged on my LetterBoxd account, from which this site drew inspiration.
        This first site shows my top movies, and how I would rate them. The next site if for you to search for movies, and to see their ratings based
        on The Movie Database. Also, you can click on the images of the posters to go to their page on IMDb!
