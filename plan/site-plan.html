			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this site is to showcase my top-rated movies in a clean, visually appealing way that
                mirrors the functionality of Letterboxd. This site will highlight my personal taste in film, provide meaningful
                descriptions of why I like each movie, and allow visitors to explore my movie rankings. 
            </p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The intended audience of this site is my classmates, my teacher, friends, and anyone who loves movies. The site
                is intended to reach those that love movies, but are also looking for movie recommendations from someone who has
                seen a lot of movies, me.
            </p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>
                This website will feature a lot of dynamic elements using JavaScript to enhance interactivity:
                <ul>- A movie gallery generated from a JavaScript array of objects, where each object contains details such as title, year, genre, rating, and poster image.</ul>
                <ul>- A search bar and filter options that allow users to sort and filter movies by rating, release year, or genre using array methods like filter, map, and sort.</ul>
                <ul>- A Random Movie Recommendation feature that selects a film from the array and displays it using conditional logic.</ul>
            </p>

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<table class="colors">

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>I don't have the images yet, but there will be images of posters for all 
                of the movies that I will have featured. I will display a home page, with a random 
                movie on display, which will take information from the js file to import that, with a random 
                generator.
            </p>
			<h3>Movies page</h3>
			<p>
                This is the same for my movie page, but on this page you can search for a movie, or find a 
                movie based on a filter or sort. This way, you can find the genre, year, rating, etc. for a specific 
                group of movies that you are looking for. 
            </p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				Underneath of the featured movie of the day, will be a random generator, that will display the 
                same thing, but there will be a button to randomly generate another movie, which will then 
                populate that movie's information into the section.
			</p>
			<img src="WireframePage1.png" alt="home page wireframe" />

			<h3>Movies page</h3>
			<p>
				When you click on the image of a movie that pops up, the information that I put in there will 
                pop up on the side, with a more detailed description of that movie.
